Hades is my laptop, this repository is the collection of configurations that I learned over time. 

This repository is mainly applies to Unix based systems and contributions are more then welcome, feel free to reach me out at [rec.manish.sahani@gmail.com](mailto:rec.manish.sahani@gmail.com).
    
## Tooling is hard! and necessary

I have covered all the configurations in a detailed tutorial, If you like to read more about step by step configuration, please see the docs folder or visit [http://noexcept.me/dotfiles]().

just to show you the gist of what this repository will achieve, below is how the terminal looks after installation.

### Detailed Installtion 

See the tutorial under `docs`, and follow the steps (follow only of your need).

### Quick Installation 

The system must support basic languages (has `xcode--select`) and have `brew` installed. If you don't have these things see the `docs` for help. 

```bash
# Install xcode-select (if not present)
xcode-select --install

# Install brew (if not present)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)
```
